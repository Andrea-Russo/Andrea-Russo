Theoretical Physicists PhD and aspiring Quant
---------------------------------------------

I'm a physicist deeply fascinated by the intricate world of theoretical physics, and I've recently expanded my horizons into the realm of quantitative finance, certified with a CQF. While I'm relatively new to the finance sector, I bring with me a solid foundation in physics and a genuine enthusiasm for applying my analytical skills in this new field. My journey so far has been a blend of academic rigor and practical exploration. I've been fortunate to delve into Python-based data engineering and machine learning, finding great joy in wrestling with large datasets, especially in time series analysis and model building. I'm constantly learning and growing in this space, and my GitHub is a living testament to this journey. In academia, I've had the privilege of contributing to several publications and engaging with students at top-tier institutions. These experiences have not only honed my knowledge but also taught me the value of humility and the power of sharing knowledge. On this GitHub profile, you'll find my ongoing adventures in learning and applying computing techniques to finance. It's a mix of successes, challenges, and continuous learning. I'm excited to share my progress and collaborate with like-minded individuals who are also navigating this fascinating intersection of finance and technology. Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting and learning together!Here I will publish my
